# Throw away your try/catch

A presentation about error handling in JavaScript and many other languages

---

Built with golang's present tool. To run locally:

- Install `go install golang.org/x/tools/cmd/present@latest`
- Install `go install github.com/air-verse/air@latest`
- Run `air`

Honestly I wouldn't really recommend the present tool itself, but I wanted to give it a shot...
